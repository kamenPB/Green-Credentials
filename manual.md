Operations Manual


1. Data.xlsx structure

1.1 In the file there are 6 spreadsheeds - Waste, Water, Landlord Water, Electricity, Carpark Electricity and Gas, respectively. 

1.2 Data from Landlord water and Carpark electricity do not have particular slide in the presentation; could be used for further comments and/or statistics.

1.3 Each spreadsheet has specific structure(set of rows and columns) that should be strictly kept as created. Changes of structure WILL affect presentation (possibly crash). Changes in titles are allowed, though.

1.4 Editable are: Monthly data (January to December in specific years), the title and the comments section (strictly CELLS N1 and N2!). Comments are being directly displayed, and data as well after required calculations.

1.5 Ideas of comments could be included below the comments section. However, they are not affecting overall presentation. 

1.6 No formatting in the cells affects the presentation, so it is not suggested. All formatting is done internally in the code.


2. Changes of year

2.1 Notice the presentation is only comparing the 3 most recent years, that is, we only need/use data of 3 years (3 specific columns) in the spreadsheets. Hence, to add a new year, we need to remove one too.

2.2 Remove the oldest data, assuming that is the year furthest from the actual, should be the first column after the months. To remove it, right click on the column letter and delete the whole column. Make sure you shift the rest of the data to the left, if not done automatically. 

2.3 To start a new year then, you need to add a new column on a specific position, so that the initial structure is kept unchanged and calculations are done correctly. Simply, find the latest filled year, right click the column letter and insert 1 column to the right. Fill the title and the data. Re-calculations and presentation are then done automatic after a refresh.
