Operations Manual

1. Data.xlsx structure

1.1 In the file there are 6 spreadsheeds - Waste, Water, Landlord Water, Electricity, Carpark Electricity and Gas, respectively. 

1.2 Data from Landlord water and Carpark electricity do not have particular slide in the presentation; could be used for further comments and/or statistics.

1.3 Each spreadsheet has specific structure(set of rows and columns) that should be strictly kept as created. Changes of structure WILL affect presentation (possibly crash). Changes in titles are allowed, though.

1.4 Editable are: Monthly data (January to December in specific years), the title and the comments section (strictly CELLS N1 and N2!). Comments are being directly displayed, and data as well after required calculations.

1.5 Ideas of comments could be included below the comments section. However, they are not affecting overall presentation.
