Development Testing
----------------------------------------------------
Talk about lack of front end
framework (maven?)
human error in spreadsheet (wrong type, exxagerated data etc)
    template for spreadsheet 
integration testing as we go, unit testing at end for example datasets
mostly testable
    "eye-catchiness" is hard to test
    hard to cover every eventuality as data categories might change
