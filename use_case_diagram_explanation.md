To start with, we have different types of data that is being calculated every month. Electricity generated from the solar panels, gas generated from recycling the food wasteand water harvested from the rain - this is the data that Beth collects and stores in Excel spreadsheets. Later on, another actor - Cabot's staff - is allowed to edit the these if it is required. This is eventually what we are provided with, thus we enter the system we are developing. It can be seen is that a decision needs to be made - whether the data is positive or negative. In the former case, we go on to the use-case that builds a TV representation whereas in the latter case, the decision to continue or not is up to the actors (Beth and the staff). After a screen has been made, it goes to a preview stage where either Beth or the staff need to approve that the information is correct and looks good enough to be presented. Given the green light, the TV is updated and the Customers are able to view its new stats being displayed.
